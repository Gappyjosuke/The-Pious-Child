## Abstract

<div align="justify">

This project focuses on the design and development of a [*Low-Poly Interactive
Psychological Horror Game*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Psychological_horror_games) as a final year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering project in the Game Development Domain. The objective is to build a
complete, single-episode interactive experience in which gameplay progression is
driven by player interaction, internal system state changes, and event-based logic, rather
than graphical complexity.

<br>
  
The development concentrates on core technical aspects of game engineering, including
player control systems, state-based game logic, event-driven interactions, collision
handling, lighting control, audio synchronization, and real-time performance
considerations. These components are designed and implemented iteratively within a
small-team development setup, reflecting practical independent game development
workflows.

<br>

The system is implemented using the [*Unreal Game Engine*](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine) and adopts a low-poly visual style to ensure clarity, consistency, and development feasibility. The expected
outcome of this project is a stable and fully playable game episode that demonstrates
practical understanding of real-time interactive system behaviour, software integration,
and game development concepts within an undergraduate academic context.
